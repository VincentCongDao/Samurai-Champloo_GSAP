                              Mugen was born in a penal colony on the Ryukyu Islands (most likely Miyako
                              Island since it was a penal colony in the past), which in the Edo period was a
                              separate
                              kingdom with close ties to the Satsuma domain of Japan. During his childhood, Mugen
                              had to
                              resort to piracy and committed several crimes with Mukuro and his stepsister Koza.
                              One day
                              Mugen is captured by government officials and sent to be executed over a cliff.
                              Mugen
                              jumped off the cliff to escape the officials, with Mukuro and Koza watching.

                              Jin was trained by his sensei Enshiro Mariya in his dojo, where he became his
                              favorite
                              pupil. Jin also was friends with a samurai name Yukimaru whom he considered as a
                              brother.
                              One day, Enshiro asked Jin what would he think about turning the samurai school into
                              a
                              school for assassins due to Kariya Kagetoki's request. Jin refused, and Kariya
                              ordered
                              Enshiro to kill Jin in his sleep. Jin reacted instinctively, killing his master by
                              mistake
                              before fleeing as a fugitive. This causes many ronin and samurai to go after Jin
                              since he
                              killed a skilled master.

                              officials), her father was one of the leaders in the rebellion. The Japanese sought

                              help of the Dutch army which helped quell the rebellion down and the Shogunate sought for
